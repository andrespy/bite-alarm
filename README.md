### Design proposals:

# Piezo vibration sensor design.
PROS: 
    Easier to detect a bite
CONS:
    You don’t know the distance where the fish bit the bait.


 # Design based on  the mouse encoder


PROS:
    
You can know the distance of the fishing line


CONS:

    It’s possible that the fishing line will slide through the wheel.
